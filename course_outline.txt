SCaLE 13x - SCaLEU / shortcourse

Title: Embedded Linux Development with Yocto/OpenEmbedded: Easily Build A Custom Linux OS for Your Favorite Device

Facility / setup:

Pre-clone and fetch repos and downloads, provide local git and/or rsync, still need active Internet connection, but should keep most traffic local.  Need "classroom" wired or wireless infrastructure (minimum at least our own AP).  Wired GB ethernet would be ideal, can make ethernet cable a req (maximize productive time, minimize wait time).  Can let students fetch from our local mirror while we do the lecture part.

Should recommend people bring laptops and bb[w|b], rpi if possible, otherwise something with full Yocto/qemu deps.

Time-frame:

Half day course hands-on would focus on core Yocto/OE layers, default qemux86 build, and one machine (eg, RaspberryPi, BeagleBone, other).  Could seek donors to provide one board per student, could require one as part of course fee, or share a few examples for the deployment (one per student is preferable).  RPi ~$40, BBB ~$50 (plus 10% edu discount at Adafruit).  Full day course would include multiple machines/deployments, compare/contrast, more hands-on in general.  RPi is a little cheaper, but BeagleBone is now in mainline/poky and has good intro/out-of-box web (black) or serial (white) interface.



Updated SCaLE 13x 2015 Requirements:

Time-frame:

One hour for short-short version.  Approx. 20 minutes overview with slides (section 1 and 2 below) and 30 minutes demo (see section 4).  Handout covers sections 3 and 4 (with maybe a little merging/overlap between 2 and 3).

Facility / Setup

Use upstream poky (open-embedded too, check sync status of upstream repos) and meta-raspberrypi.  Pre-clone and build one each:

1) qemux86 (poky only)
2) beaglebone (poky only)
3) rpi (with upstream BSP)

Build basic console and sato/QT5 demo images (check status of sato vs. wayland as default demo image), and at least console variants with debug/other tools using image features.  Do select cleans/rebuilds and kernel rebuilds/deploys (using qemu, but talk about rebuilding images/kernels for other machines).

Recommend laptops (beaglebones/rpis optional) but not required (do we even need to?).


Description:

This is inteneded as a "bootcamp" course for embedded developers who have not used OpenEmbedded, as well as current Linux developers and users familiar with at least one common embedded Linux platform (eg, RaspberryPi, BeagleBone, Wandboard, etc).  The course will provide an in-depth overview of the Yocto Project, the core OpenEmbedded layers and what they are, supported hardware, available documentation and other resources, build requirements, and how to setup, customize, build, and deploy your own embedded Linux OS image, root filesystem, kernel and bootloader, etc.  Handout will include installing build host dependencies and Yocto, building and deploying target images/SDKs, and basic troubleshooting/debugging/WhatIfScenarios.   A laptop is recommended for either local builds (quad-core or better recommended) or local web interface (eg, Toaster).
